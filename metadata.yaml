description: Someone had stolen an important part of Steve Cornell's life. It was
  bad enough when his fianc√©e vanished. It was infinitely worse when everyone in the
  world insisted it couldn't have happened the way he knew it had. In a world where
  ESP and telepathy were normal, it was difficult to keep secrets. But Steve's search
  for his missing sweetheart brought him to the threshold of one of the greatest secrets
  of all time. And it was obvious that somebody would stop at nothing to keep him
  from uncovering it. What were the oddly sinister symbols along otherwise ordinary
  roads? What was behind the spreading plague called Mekstrom's Disease? Why were
  there "blank" spots where telepathy didn't work? Who was the elusive enemy with
  powers even beyond those ESP had bestowed on mankind? And, most important of all
  ... could Steve find that enemy before they made him vanish too?
